DLT Design Files
-----
Collection of PCB design files for DLT ( https://hackaday.io/project/164845-dlt-one-a-damn-linux-tablet ).
This project is currently in its early stages and none of the boards hosted here are necessarily fully tested, they might work but only to the extent I need them to, some features that I have not tried might not work.
I uploaded them anyway at this stage for documentation purposes and for those that are curious.

All works are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for now. The NC clause is mostly there to prevent malicious use of these designs.
If you wish to use it in a commerical context please open up an issue or get in contact with me.
