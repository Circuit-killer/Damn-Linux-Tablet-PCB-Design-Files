DLT - A Damn Linux Tablet
==========
PCB Design Files
-----
Collection of PCB and CAD design files for DLT ( https://hackaday.io/project/164845-dlt-one-a-damn-linux-tablet ).
This project is currently in its early stages and none of the files hosted here are necessarily fully tested, they might work but only to the extent I need them to, some features that I have not tried might not work.
I uploaded them anyway at this stage for documentation purposes and for those that are curious.
